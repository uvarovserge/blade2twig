# blade2twig
Converts Blade templates auto-generated by Laravel into Twig in-place

Works in most situations, but in some edge cases a manual intervention might be required

WARNING: The script is fine-tuned to work with exact files auto-generated by Laravel. I take no responsibility if you try it on some files you've tampered with and it produces rubbish

Run: `php blade2twig.php`

Set `DELETE_ORIGINALS` to `false` if you want to experiment first. You can always run it again with `true` which will delete `.blade.php` files
